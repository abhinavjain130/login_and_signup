# login_and_signup

A Clear, Concise layout of Username & Password field, and quite colourful visual is what I wanted to achieve in Front-End Development for making a website & I did.

I would like to share that I made a responsive login page (VTOP) created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The login page is fully responsive, meaning it will look great on any device.
This project was a great way for me to learn something new and create something of my own choice.
I used the following skills:

⭐HTML to create the basic structure of the page

⭐CSS to style the page and make it responsive

⭐JS to add functionality to the page

I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a front-end web developer.
